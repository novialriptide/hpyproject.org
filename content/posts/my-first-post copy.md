Welcome to the shiny new HPy blog!

HPy has been around for a while now. The initial discussion started during
EuroPython 2019, in the good old times when we could still go to conferences
and have real-life meetings. Since then, HPy progressed **a lot** from the
point of view of the actual code, but we have been a bit too silent
w.r.t. communicating what we are doing to the external world and to the broader
Python community. Hopefully, now that this blog is online we will do a better
job at periodically communicating the status of HPy.
